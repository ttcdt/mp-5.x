2.81
----

* Internal changes:

The repository has been moved in mp-5.x.

2.80
----

* Internal changes:

Integer values are stored directly into the payload of mpdm_t instead of in their own, allocated buffer, resulting in a somewhat significant memory saving.

* New functions:

mpdm_socket_timeout(sock, r_to, s_to), to set the receiving and/or sending timeouts for a socket (in seconds). If any timeout is set to NULL, it's not touched.

* Bug fixes:

mpdm_fmt() no longer miscalculates the size of non-string values printed with the %s command.

2.79
----

* New functions:

mpdm_data(), to return the data inside an mpdm_t.

2.78
----

* Important changes:

The memory footprint of an mpdm_t has been shrinked from 24 to 16 bytes.

* New features:

mpdm_read_zip_file() has been implemented (instead of being just a stub).

2.77
----

* New functions:

mpdm_divide(num, den) to divide two values. It works as expected for integers and reals, but additionally behaves as mpdm_split() if num is as string.

* Bug fixes:

Maximum size limitation in mpdm_fmt() when parsing %s.

* Other changes:

If the separator in mpdm_split() is the empty string (""), it behaves the same as if it's NULL.

Added some whitespace to JSON output.

2.76
----

* API changes:

The macro MPDM_CAN_EXEC() no longer exists and has been replaced by function mpdm_can_exec().

2.75

Crash when stringifying very big floats.

Fixed compilation under FreeBSD.

* Other new features:

File values can also be accessed by integer, that is used as a file offset.

A new environment variable MPDM_HASH_FUNC allows the external choosing of the hashing functions in objects. Possible values are "fnv", "std" or "null".

2.72
----

* New features:

New function mpdm_md5(), that returns the MD5 of a string as an hexadecimal string.

2.71
----

* New features:

mpdm_sscanf() now implements `%w', to match alphabetic words (according to the locale); `%W', to match the inverse; and `%r', to match the rest of the string.

2.70
----

* New functions:

mpdm_server(addr, port), that creates a socket in listen mode.

mpdm_accept(sock), that accepts a connection from a server socket created by mpdm_server().

2.69
----

* New functions:

mpdm_read_zip_mem(), to read a file from a compressed .zip file in memory.

mpdm_read_arch_mem(), to read a file from any in-memory archive format with autodetection (by now, only tar and zip files are supported).

mpdm_read_arch_mem_s(), to read a file from any in-memory archive as a string.

mpdm_read_arch_file(), to read a file from an on-disk archive file (only tar files are supported).

mpdm_read_arch_file_s(), to read a file from an on-disk archive as a string.

2.68
----

* New features:

omap() with two array arguments generates an object with values from the first one with indexes from the second one.

2.67
----

* New features:

omap() with a NULL filter returns a copy of the original set (instead of an inverse object).

2.66
----

* New features:

New function mpdm_flock(), implement UNIX flock(). Does nothing under win32.

2.65
----

* New features:

Fixed dubious code that was causing crashes in OpenBSD.

2.64
----

----

* Internal changes:

Support non-array return values in omap(): If the filter in omap() returns a non-array, use this as the value for the return object (keeping the same index).

Use v, i order in omap() filter function: For symmetry, if the filter function in omap() returns an array, it must be in the original order [v, i] and not reversed.

2.62
----

* Internal changes:

the object hash function has been tweaked to improve distribution.

2.61
----

* Internal changes:

Many functions have been refactorized into the VC structures.

mpdm_is_true() and mpdm_count() now use mpdm_type_vc.

2.56
----

* Internal changes:

Function mpdm_type_vc() now accepts as argument an mpdm_t instead of an mpdm_type_t.

2.55
----

* Internal changes:

There is a new structure per type that contains its name and pointers to the virtual calls for several functions (as of now, only destroy()).

2.54
----

* New features:

File descriptors are now executable; by executing one without arguments, a line is read; otherwise, it there are arguments, all of them are written into it.

New function mpdm_utf8_to_wc().

New function mpdm_chomp().

mpdm_write() also accepts arrays and files as the argument to be written, iterating it recursively.

* Important changes:

The mpdm_hmap() function has been renamed to mpdm_omap().

New function mpdm_multiply(), supporting number * number, string * number and array * number.

New function mpdm_substract(), supporting number - number, array1 - array2 (returning a new array with the elements in array1 that are *not* in array2), array - object (returning an array with the keys *not* in object), object1 - object2 (returning a new object with the elements in object1 *not* in object2) and object - array (returning a new object with the elements in object that are *not* indexed by any element of array).

Pipes now inherit the environment from the ENV object.

New function mpdm_gzip_inflate().

New functions mpdm_read_tar_mem() and mpdm_read_tar_file().

mpdm_join() and mpdm_join_wcs() now can accept files.

Read and write encoders for Windows-1252 code page.

The object interface now replaces the old hash interface, that it's still available as a compatibility layer.

New function mpdm_escape(), to escape a range of characters in a string.

map() with a string filter is accepted as a mpdm_fmt() format and used as is, expecting one % mark (or none, in case of mapping string constants).

In mpdm_fmt() the %b (output number as binary) now accepts zero-padding and maximum number of digits.

2.42
----

* Important changes:

License change: released into the public domain.

* Architectural changes:

Values now have a type and no flags.

There is a clear differentiation between integers, reals and strings. Also, they can be iterated specially.

A semantic change to mpdm_read(): EOLs are purely treated as line separators, so if a read reaches EOF but previous line had an EOL, a final, empty line is returned.

Extended values no longer exist, nor cached ival and rval.

Renamed most functions that used wide strings and ended with _s to _wcs (e.g. mpdm_cmp_s() to mpdm_cmp_wcs()).

* New features:

Files can work in auto-chomp mode (automatic clipping of the EOL sequence). This sequence can be retrieved using the file function mpdm_eol(). Auto-chomping is enabled by setting the global AUTO_CHOMP variable to true, checked on each call to mpdm_open().

mpdm_join() can join integers and reals by summing them.

utf-8 reading and writing is done upto 4 bytes.

New function mpdm_random() (moved from MPSL). Accepts an integer [0, range), NULL [0.0, 1.0) or an array to pick one of its elements.

mpdm_regcomp() is now non-static and can be used to use compiled regexes as pure values.

mpdm_map() can map strings to regexes (providing the same functionality as the dropped 'g' flag in regexes).

mpdm_map() can map iterable values to strings, returning an array with the same string many times.

mpdm_map() can also map iterable values to arrays, using them as translation tables.

New function mpdm_count(), to return a type-specific number of elements (values in arrays and objects and size of stringify value otherwise).

Read and write encoders for MSDOS codepages 437 and 850.

mpdm_splice() also works with arrays. Also, its syntax has changed and no longer returns a two-value array but accepts optional pointers to values.

New function mpdm_del(), complementary to mpdm_get() and mpdm_set() (multitype).

New function mpdm_type() to get a value's type.

New function mpdm_type_wcs() to get a value's type as a string.

* Dropped features:

Flags `l' (last) and `g' (global) in regexes are no longer supported.

mpdm_slice() no longer exists (use mpdm_splice()).

As flags have disappeared, all macros for testing them are also gone. Do the checking using types.

MPDM_LS() no longer exists; replace it with MPDM_S() and move on.

Channels no longer exist.

2.30
----

* Architectural changes:

Moved "destroy" functions from the extended values to a global type information structure.

2.21
----

* New features:

Added the concept of "extended" values: they contain an addition "destroy" function, called when the value is destroyed. Also, only these extended values stored cached ival and rval. This way, many values use much less memory.

* Other changes:

mpdm_iterator() has changed the order of args from k, v to v, i.

The version numbering has changed from X.X.X to X.XXX (real number).

2.1.6
-----

* Bug fixes:

Dump backslashes correctly in JSON.

2.1.5
-----

* Bug fixes:

Escape the base directory in glob().

Fix a parsing bug in json_lexer().

* New features:

New array function mpdm_reverse().

2.1.4
-----

* New features:

Use the APPID variable in mpdm_app_dir().

2.1.2
-----

* New features:

mpdm_join() joins more types.

mpdm_iterator() returns index/element pairs when iterating an array and can also iterate files and numbers.

New function mpdm_fmt(), like mpdm_sprintf() but for only one value. As a bonus it includes the percent-commands `j' (output as JSON) and `t' (followed by a curly brace-enclosed strftime() format).

mpdm_sscanf() also supports a %t command, to parse a time string (inverse of the one in mpdm_fmt(), and %j, to parse a JSON string.

New channel implementation (bidirectional communication for threads).

New function mpdm_rename().

New function mpdm_slice().

New function mpdm_getcwd().

2.1.1
-----

* New features:

mpdm_join() allows the joining of two arrays.

New function mpdm_set().

2.1.0
-----

* New features:

Support for client TCP/IP connections via the new mpdm_connect() function.

New function mpdm_tr(), to transliterate strings.

* Bugfixes:

The pclose() win32 implementation returns the process exit status correctly.

2.0.1
-----

* Optimizations:

Numeric values created with MPDM_I() and MPDM_R() do not have their string representation created until needed by a call to mpdm_string() (which can never happen).

* New features:

New function mpdm_sget_i().

New macros MPDM_AA() and MPDM_AS(), for local stack-allocated (i.e. using alloca()) arrays and strings, meant to be used for optimized, short-lived temporary values.

2.0.0
-----

* New features:

The system has been refactored to be a pure reference counting system, so sweeping / garbage collection no longer exists.

Executable values and functions now include a new argument to hold a context (used to implement local symbol tables and such).

mpdm_adel() and mpdm_hdel() no longer return the deleted element.

mpdm_aset() and mpdm_hset() no longer return the old element.

mpdm_sort() sorts the array instead of returning a new one.

New functions mpdm_strcat_sn(), mpdm_pokewsn(), mpdm_join_s(), mpdm_split_s(), mpdm_cmp_s(), mpdm_strcat_s().

Some refactoring to diminish memory usage (no more `prev' pointers in the value list, less residual values).

mpdm_regex() always return an array in global searches (maybe an empty one) and if searching for an array of regexes (maybe be a partial one).

The following functions had had their arguments swapped:

mpdm_split() and mpdm_split_s().

mpdm_join() and mpdm_join_s().

mpdm_sscanf().

mpdm_regex().

mpdm_sregex().
