MPDM (Minimum Profit Data Manager)
==================================

MPDM (Minimum Profit Data Manager) is a lightweight library that provides C
programs with a rich set of useful data types as scalars, dynamic arrays
(i.e. indexed by number) and associative arrays (i.e. indexed by a string
key). Also, it contains a rudimentary garbage collector that alleviates the
need to keep track of data no longer useful, as well as help for operating
system abstraction and portability, regular expressions, string manipulation,
character set conversions, localization, file I/O access, pipes and
multithreading (threads, semaphores and mutexes).

This software is released into the public domain. See LICENSE file for details.

Additionally, the following files not authored by the ttcdt are included
in this repository:

 * wcwidth.c: author Markus Kuhn, public domain (or so it seems),
 * puff.c: author Mark Adler, public domain (or so it seems),
 * md5.h and md5.c: author Alexander Peslyak, public domain,
 * gnu_regex.h and gnu_regex.c: author FSF, license GPL.

I think the GNU regex can be included here, but IANAL. It's used only on those
platforms without native regex support in its libc (i.e. windows), so it
should count as a library linkage exception or something like that.
