MPSL internals
==============

This document describes some internal details of this MPSL implementation.

The symbol table
----------------

There are three different scopes for a symbol in MPSL: global (accesible
from everywhere), local to subroutine (accesible from the subroutine where
it's defined) or local to block (accesible from the block where it's
defined). The priority for symbols with the same name is, obviously,
inverse: a local to block symbol obscures a local to subroutine one, and
both a global one. Also, as blocks can be nested, local values defined in
the inner blocks obscure the ones defined outside.

The global symbol table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global symbol table is the simpler one: all global symbols are keys of
the root hash (as returned from mpdm's function mpdm_root()). Once a
global symbol is defined, it's stored there until explicit deletion or
host program termination. MPSL library functions are also global symbols,
and share the same namespace.

The local symbol table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The local symbol table is an array of hashes. The array is used as a stack,
and symbols are searched in the stacked hashes from top to bottom.

The bytecode
------------

When the compiler parses a MPSL source code file, it generates a bunch of
MPSL instructions, each one stored in a mpdm array. This (usually small)
array contains in the first element a scalar value, the _opcode_, and
optionally other values, that are also MPSL instructions (unless in a very
special case) and act as the opcode's arguments. All instructions return a
value after execution. A MPSL compiled program is a chain of instructions
that call each other.

A description of each opcode follows:

LITERAL
~~~~~~~

 LITERAL <value>

A LITERAL instruction clones (using mpdm_clone()) and returns the stored
value. This is the special case described in the introduction paragraph;
the arguments for all other instructions are themselves instructions.

MULTI
~~~~~

 MULTI <ins1> <ins2>

A MULTI instruction executes `ins1', then `ins2', and returns the exit
value of the second one.

IMULTI
~~~~~~

 IMULTI <ins1> <ins2>

An IMULTI instruction executes `ins1', then `ins2', and returns the exit
value of the first one.

SYMVAL
~~~~~~

 SYMVAL <ins1>

A SYMVAL instruction executes `ins1' and accepts its return value as a
symbol name, that is looked up in the symbol table and its assigned value
(if any) returned.

ASSIGN
~~~~~~

 ASSIGN <ins1> <ins2>

An ASSIGN instruction executes `ins1' and accepts its return value as a
symbol name; then `ins2' is executed and its return value assigned to that
symbol. The new value is returned.

EXECSYM
~~~~~~~

 EXECSYM <ins1>
 EXECSYM <ins1> <ins2>

An EXECSYM instruction takes the value of the symbol returned by `ins1' and
accepts its return value as an executable one; if it exists, executes `ins2'
and accepts its return value as a list of arguments for the executable
value; then it's executed and its exit value returned.

THREADSYM
~~~~~~~~~

 THREADSYM <ins1>
 THREADSYM <ins1> <ins2>

A THREADSYM instruction takes the value of the symbol returned by `ins1' and
accepts its return value as an executable one; if it exists, executes `ins2'
and accepts its return value as a list of arguments for the executable
value; then it's executed as a new thread and a handle to it returned.

IF
~~

 IF <ins1> <ins2>
 IF <ins1> <ins2> <ins3>

An IF instruction executes `ins1' and, if it returns a true value,
executes `ins2' and returns its value. If it's not true, returns NULL or,
if `ins3' is defined, executes it and returns its value.

WHILE
~~~~~

 WHILE <ins1> <ins2>
 WHILE <ins1> <ins2> <ins3> <ins4>

A WHILE instruction executes `ins1' and, if it's a true value, executes
`ins2'. This operation is repeated until `ins1' returns a non-true value.
It always returns NULL.

In the 4 argument version, `ins3' is executed just before entering the
loop and `ins4' executed just after `ins2' on each loop (i.e. it
behaves like C language's `for' construction).

LOCAL
~~~~~

 LOCAL <ins1>

A LOCAL instruction executes `ins1' and takes its return value as an array
of symbol names to be created in the local symbol table. It always returns
NULL.

UMINUS
~~~~~~

 UMINUS <ins1>

An UMINUS instruction executes `ins1', gets its value as a real number and
returns the unary minus operation on it (effectively multiplying it by -1).

Math operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 ADD <ins1> <ins2>
 SUB <ins1> <ins2>
 MUL <ins1> <ins2>
 DIV <ins1> <ins2>
 MOD <ins1> <ins2>
 POW <ins1> <ins2>

These instructions execute the addition, substraction, multiply, divide,
modulo and power math operations from the exit values of the two
instructions, and return the result. Values are treated as real numbers
except in MOD, where they are treated as integers.

NOT
~~~

 NOT <ins1>

A NOT instruction executes `ins1', takes its return value as a boolean
one, and returns its negation.

AND
~~~

 AND <ins1> <ins2>

An AND instruction executes `ins1'. If its return value is accepted as a
non-true value, returns it; otherwise, executes `ins2' and returns its
value. This is a short-circuiting operation; if `ins1' is non-true, `ins2'
is never executed.

OR
~~

 OR <ins1> <ins2>

An OR instruction executes `ins1'. If its return value is accepted as a
true value, returns it; otherwise, executes `ins2' and returns its value.
This is a short-circuiting operation; if `ins1' is true, `ins2' is never
executed.

Numeric comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 NUMEQ <ins1> <ins2>
 NUMLT <ins1> <ins2>
 NUMLE <ins1> <ins2>
 NUMGT <ins1> <ins2>
 NUMGE <ins1> <ins2>

These instructions execute the equality, less-than, less-or-equal-than,
greater-than and greater-or-equal-than numeric comparisons on the exit
values of `ins1' and `ins2', and return a boolean value.

Bitwise operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 BITAND <ins1> <ins2>
 BITOR <ins1> <ins2>
 BITXOR <ins1> <ins2>

Returns the bitwise operation between the exit values of `ins1' and `ins2'.

Bitwise shifts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 SHL <ins1> <ins2>
 SHR <ins1> <ins2>

Returns the bitwise shifting of the exit value of `ins1', `ins2' bits
to the left or right.

JOIN
~~~~

 JOIN <ins1> <ins2>

A JOIN instruction executes both `ins1' and `ins2', and joins the
two exit values (being scalars, arrays, hashes or combinations, as accepted
by the mpdm_join() function).

STREQ
~~~~~

 STREQ <ins1> <ins2>

A STREQ instruction executes both `ins1' and `ins2', tests for string equality
of both values, and returns a boolean value.

BREAK
~~~~~

 BREAK

A BREAK instruction forces the exit of a loop as WHILE or FOREACH. Returns
NULL.

RETURN
~~~~~~

 RETURN
 RETURN <ins1>

A RETURN instruction forces the exit of the current subroutine. If `ins1'
is defined, it's executed and its value returned, or NULL otherwise.

FOREACH
~~~~~~~

 FOREACH <ins1> <ins2> <ins3>

A FOREACH instruction executes `ins1' and accepts its return value as a
symbol name, and executes `ins2' and accepts its return value as an array
to be iterated onto. Then, in a loop, each element in `ins2' is assigned
to `ins1' and `ins3' executed. NULL is always returned.

RANGE
~~~~~

 RANGE <ins1> <ins2>

A RANGE instruction executes both `ins1' and `ins2' and, taken their
return values as real numbers, returns an array containing a sequence of
all the values in between (including them).

LIST
~~~~

 LIST <ins>
 LIST <ins> <array_value>

A LIST instruction returns an array. If `array_value' does not exist, a
new one is created. The return value of `ins' is pushed into the array,
which is returned.

ILIST
~~~~

 ILIST <ins>
 ILIST <ins> <array_value>

Same as the LIST instruction, but the value is inserted from the start
of the array instead of pushed at the end.

HASH
~~~~

 HASH <ins1> <ins2>
 HASH <ins1> <ins2> <hash_value>

A HASH instruction returns a hash. If `hash_value' does not exist, a
new one is created. The return values of `ins1' and `ins2' are used as
a key, value pair that is inserted into the hash, which is returned.

SUBFRAME
~~~~~~~~

 SUBFRAME <ins1>

A SUBFRAME instruction creates a subroutine frame, executes `ins1',
destroys the subroutine frame and returns `ins1' exit value.

BLKFRAME
~~~~~~~~

 BLKFRAME <ins1>

A BLKFRAME instruction creates a block frame, executes `ins1',
destroys the block frame and returns `ins1' exit value.
