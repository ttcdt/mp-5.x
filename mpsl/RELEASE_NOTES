The (already deprecated) function keys() no longer exist. Use map(index) instead.

2.63
----

* New features:

Updated maintainers.

2.56
----

* New features:

New function swap(). It's only meant as a special construction to be used with omap(), to create a new object swapping their values and keys. It must be used to replace the usage of omap() without arguments, that will be rendered obsolete in next MPDM version.

Changed mpsl_find_in_embedded_tar() to use an mpdm_t.

2.54
----

The ad-hoc compiler now accepts source code with utf-8 characters without problems.

New function chomp().

The INC array can be NULL to use load() with direct paths.

New function index(). It's only meant as a special construction to be used with map() to get the indexes of an iterator, so that constructions like `iterable->map(sub (v, i) { i; } );' can be written as `iterable->map(index)' to get the same results.

* Important changes:

The hmap() function has been renamed to omap().

2.53
----

* New features:

New function feof().

The ad-hoc compiler now takes into account files starting with #!.

Some memory leaks.

2.51
----

This release has the ad-hoc compiler (a-mpsl) as the default.

The `*' operator now allows multiplication for number * number, string * number and array * number.

The `-' operator now allows substraction for number - number, array - array, array - object, object - array and object - object.

Division and module opcodes generate a "Division by zero" MPSL error instead of just crashing the program.

2.30

New functions bitand(), bitor() and bitxor(). The associated operators no longer work.

New functions bitshl() and bitshr(), replacing the `<<' and `>>' operators.

New function pow() (power), replacing the `**' operator.

New API function mpsl_constant_fold().

The time() function now also contains fractional time.

New operator `$', like an inverse call to fmt() (for example, `255 $ "%x"' returns "ff").

New function escape(), to escape a range of characters in a string.

* Changes:

The `||=' operator has been changed to `|='.

* Internal changes:

Next major version will include an ad-hoc compiler, that will replace the current flex+yacc one. They will coexist and be switchable during some versions. Some internal changes has been necessary, but should not be noticeable.

Some executor opcodes has been changed (again, should not be noticeable).

* Dropped features:

The `**' operator is no longer supported.

The `&', `|', `^', `&=', `|=' and `^=' are no longer supported.

The `>>', `<<', `>>=' and `<<=' operators are no longer supported.

Fixed return value for unlink() and rename() (-1 on errors).

2.27
----

* Important changes:

License change: released into the public domain.

* New features:

The `+' operator can be used for concatenating strings, arrays and objects. This makes the `~' operator redundant.

The comparison operators `==', `!=', `<', `>', `<=' and `>=' can now be used to compare all types, not only numbers.

The random() function now accepts arrays as arguments and NULL, to return a number from 0.0 to 1.0 (not included).

New function regcomp(), to compile regexes.

New function count(), to return the number of elements of any type.

New conversion functions integer(), real() and string().

The print() function now prints a space between arguments and always print an end of line.

New function set(), to be used with applicable every type.

New function del(), to be used with applicable every type.

* Other changes:

The old "scalar" type is now "string".

The file_eol() function has been renamed to eol().

* Dropped features:

The functions is_array() and is_hash() no longer exist. Use type().

2.25
----

* New features:

A new foreach (v, i, a) construction, that iterates `a' setting `v' and `i' with each value and index.

New function type(), that returns the type of a value as a string.

New function get(), that returns an element of a set (like using []).

New function file_eol(), that returns the EOL sequence detected in previous call to read().

New function bool().

Now map() can iterate scalars (i.e. integers), arrays, hashes or files. The filter can be undefined, so the values are returned untouched.

In map(), filters that are strings are assumed to be regexps.

The write() function now returns the fd instead of a byte count.

New API function mpsl_find_in_embedded_tar().

* Other changes:

The version numbering has changed from X.X.X to X.XXX (real number).

2.2.3
-----

* New features:

New function getcwd().

New function reverse().

2.2.2
-----

* New features:

The ~ operator is no longer limited to concatenating strings, but can be used to join all kinds of data values (like the one from MPSL 3.x).

New operator ||= (so that `a ||= 2' is equivalent to `a = a || 2'.

New operator ~= (so `a ~= b' is the same as `a = a ~ b').

New function slice().

2.2.1
-----

* New features:

New function rename().

* Bugfixes:

Error in random().

2.2.0
-----

* New features:

By the new() operator and the usage of the -> operator as a method call, it helps implementing simple object-oriented programming.

* New features:

A new C-like for() control flow construction.

Updated to match MPDM refactoring (no more sweeping / garbage collection).

Support for semaphore values.

* Changes:

Any function argument not explicitly declared and sent as argument in the function call is stored in the local array _ (underscore).
