for the user to select one. The selected one will be called as the only argument
for the `make' program and its output read. All output will be catched and shown
in a read-only document. Compiler errors and warnings will be highlighted and
can be navigated by using the `seek_next' and `seek_prev' actions (keys `f3' and
