Minimum Profit character encoding support
=========================================

This document describes the character encodings supported by the
Minimum Profit text editor and the performed autodetection tests.

None (default locale)
---------------------

The following steps are performed on input:

 * If any utf BOM is found, it sets the document encoding to any of
   `utf-8bom', `utf-16le', `utf-16be', `utf-32le' or `utf-32be';
 * Otherwise, if an explicit utf-8 sequence is detected, it sets the
   document encoding to `utf-8';
 * Otherwise, if some character is found with the 7 bit set (that is,
   a non-ASCII character), but does not conform to the utf-8 standard,
   it sets the document encoding to `8bit';
 * In any other case, no encoding is forced, and the file is read using
   the locale conversion functions.

On output, the document is saved using the locale conversion functions.

utf-8
-----

The following steps are performed on input:

 * If an utf-8 BOM is found, it sets the document encoding to `utf-8bom';
 * In any other case, utf-8 is assumed as the character encoding and any
   invalid character combination is converted to the `?' character.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-8 encoding without a BOM
prefix.

utf-8bom
--------

On input, if no utf-8 BOM is found, the encoding is still assumed to be
`utf-8', but not changed to it.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-8 encoding with a BOM
prefix.

8bit
----

No character conversion is done on input nor output.

iso8859-1
---------

Characters are treated as being encoded using the iso8859-1 character set,
that is, no real conversion is done. This mode is really identical to
`8bit'.

Aliases: `latin1'.

utf-16
------

On input, it tries to determine the endianness of the document by reading
the BOM; if a valid one is found, encoding is set to `utf-16le' or
`utf-16be'; if none is found, it assumes `utf-16le'.

On output, it behaves like `utf-16le'.

Aliases: `ucs-2'.

utf-16le
--------

On input, it assumes utf-16 little endian characters.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-16 little endian encoding
with a BOM prefix.

Aliases: `ucs-2le'.

utf-16be
--------

On input, it assumes utf-16 big endian characters.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-16 big endian encoding
with a BOM prefix.

Aliases: `ucs-2be'.

utf-32
------

On input, it tries to determine the endianness of the document by reading
the BOM; it a valid one is found, encoding is set to `utf-32le' or
`utf-32be'; if none is found, it assumes `utf-32le'.

On output, it behaves like `utf-32le'.

Aliases: `ucs-4'.

utf-32le
--------

On input, it assumes utf-32 little endian characters.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-32 little endian encoding
with a BOM prefix.

Aliases: `ucs-4le'.

utf-32be
--------

On input, it assumes utf-32 big endian characters.

On output, it saves the document using the utf-32 big endian encoding
with a BOM prefix.

Aliases: `ucs-4be'.

msdos-437
---------

On input and output, uses the MSDOS 437 (original IBM PC) code page.

msdos-850
---------

On input and output, uses the MSDOS 850 (DOS Latin 1) code page.

windows-1252
------------

On input and output, uses the Windows-1252 code page, also misnomed
everywhere as ANSI. Many texts that claim to be iso8859-1 are really
windows-1252.

Iconv support
-------------

If Minimum Profit is compiled with support for the `iconv' library, many
more encodings will be available. There is no easy way of knowing their
names; the underlying system may provide the `iconv --list' command to have
a list.

End of line markers
-------------------

Though not directly related to character encodings, the Minimum Profit text
editor remembers the end of line marker found inside each document, and use
it when saving it afterwards. This helps in maintaining document
compatibility and portability. This behaviour can be disabled by setting
the `mp.config.keep_eol' configuration directive to 0.
